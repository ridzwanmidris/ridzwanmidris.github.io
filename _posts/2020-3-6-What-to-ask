title: What should you be asking?
---

These are just some of the questions I agree (cos they're not my own) that is reasonable for a data scientist to ask. I will be using these for all my projects now onwards. It may not be perfect, but I feel it it somewhere to start with.

_What do you want, exactly?

What should it look like, exactly?

When do you want it?

What does your boss want to do with what you do with it?

What is important to you?

Why do you want it?

How will you use it?

Who will use it?

Who might use it?

Where will the output be stored?

How often will you use it?

How often may you use it?

What accuracy do you want?

Will this need to be changed in the future?

After these questions are asked they should know to come back with questions like:

This is a mockup of the output you described, the way I understand it. Is that what you imagined?

Are there things you feel I'm unclear about?

How do you feel about what it looks like?_

Now, let's find ourselves a good project to work on!
