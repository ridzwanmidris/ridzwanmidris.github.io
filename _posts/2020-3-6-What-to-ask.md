title: What should you be asking?
---

These are just some of the questions I agree (cos they're not my own) that is reasonable for a data scientist to ask. I will be using these for all my projects now onwards. It may not be perfect, but I feel it is somewhere to start with.

_What do you want, exactly?_

_What should it look like, exactly?_

_When do you want it?_

_What does your boss want to do with what you do with it?_

_What is important to you?_

_Why do you want it?_

_How will you use it?_

_Who will use it?_

_Who might use it?_

_Where will the output be stored?_

_How often will you use it?_

_How often may you use it?_

_What accuracy do you want?_

_Will this need to be changed in the future?_

After these questions are asked, you should know to come back with questions like:

_This is a mockup of the output you described, the way I understand it. Is that what you imagined?_

_Are there things you feel I'm unclear about?_

_How do you feel about what it looks like?_

Now, let's find ourselves a good project to work on!
